            I'm back again, hoping to bring the latest version to a point I'm satisfied with!

        <p>
            I had stepped away from this project for a while, ghosting everything and everyone. I really don't
            work on Roblox projects often, so working on this, it was a bit overwhelming, and the constraints
            that were imposed on me felt confining. So I took a break, tried creating this in unity, but decided
            I wanted to come back to this project, right here!
