        So, yah, I stepped away for a long while. I might be back, but I'm unsure.

            So, yah, I stepped away from the project again, for a considerable amount of time. This is becoming a trend, isn't it?

            As I mentioned in the previous update, Roblox development isn't really my main area, and after some medial nonsense, I sort
            of lost intrest in this project for a while, or at least, never was intrested enough to work on it. I do want to try and work
            on this more, and eventually create a unity copy. Who knows, maybe I'll do it this time?
