        <p>
            When this game was first built, it was just a simple project I created when I was bored. I had made it in a day or two, and hadn't put much effort into many parts of it.
            This meant a very ugly looking ui. However, in this update, this is one of the biggest things I set out to change!

        <p>
            The UI has been entirely redesigned from the ground up, with some actual thought and effort being put in to making it look nice, be adaptive, and be functional.
            I am not much of a UI person, and don't have too much experience in this area, so I did some research, and tried to create a decent looking UI to replace the
            bland and basic original system.
